    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <div>
      During this study you will be paired with a robot and faced with solving a set of mazes of varying difficulty. The
      goal is to get the robot to the finish (denoted by the green square). At any time you may choose how the robot is
      controlled: you can drive the robot (Manual Control), or let the robot automatically drive to the finish
      (Automatic Control).

      <br><br>The robot can see the entire maze (both explored and unexplored areas) but has difficulty seeing broken glass
      which can confuse its sensors and may cause it to move in a random direction. You are only able to see the small
      portion of the maze explored during your interaction with the robot (including nearby obstacles, holes, and glass).
      Driving over or falling into a hole will cause you and the robot fail the maze, so you will have to work together
      to make it to the finish.

      <br><br>You will interact with 4 different robots during this study, each a different color and each with different capabilities. With each robot you
      will complete 1-3 mazes. At the end of the 1-3 mazes you will be asked a series of questions about the robot you just worked with.

    <h3>You will be presented with a display to help navigate the maze:</h3>

    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h3>At any time during the maze, take control the robot yourself by clicking Manual Control. Use the Up, Left, Right, and Down buttons to drive:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/manual_control.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h3>At any time during the maze, let the robot drive itself to the finish (to the best of its ability) by selecting Automatic Control. You can end Automatic
      Control at any time by pressing the Manual Control button:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/automatic_control.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h3>There will be glass like debris in the maze. If the robot is driving in Automatic Control, and it drives over this debris, it could move randomly in any direction:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/glass.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h3>But watch out! If the robot falls in a hole you will fail the maze:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/holes.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h3>If you don't think you can complete the maze you can abort it:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/abort.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    You will receive a score based on how well you and the robot perform on each maze. At the end of the HIT you will be
    paid a bonus based on your final score and the effort you put into the experiment. Each maze is worth
    5 bonus points. <u>Your goal should be to maximize points based on the below scoring breakdown:</u>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Fail maze (robot falls in a hole):</b> -5 points</li>
      <li><b>Abort maze (press abort button):</b> -3 points</li>
      <li><b>Drive in Manual Control:</b> -0.1 points per manual step</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The robot can see both explored and unexplored areas</li>
      <li>Manual Control allows you to drive with the up/down/left/right buttons</li>
      <li>Automatic Control lets the robot drive to the finish (to the best of its abilities)</li>
      <li>Glass may cause the robot to move in an unexpected direction</li>
      <li>Falling in a hole fails the maze</li>
      <li>You can abort if you are unable to get the robot to the finish</li>
      <li>You will be paired with different robots (each a different color) throughout this study</li>
