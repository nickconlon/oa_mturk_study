    <h2>Hello!</h2>
  </div>
  <div>
    We are interested in studying how a human and a robot counterpart can solve a navigation task together. Here you will be faced
    with a set of mazes of varying difficulty and paired with a robot of varying capability. You will have the option of
    driving the robot, or letting the robot automatically drive. There will be dangers in the maze which you will need to
    avoid. Your view of the mazes, and control you have of the robot will be limited, so you must work together with your
    new robot partner. There will be three sets of mazes in total, each with a new robot. Each new set of mazes will be
    preceded by a short tutorial to help you get to know your new robot partner. Your job is to work with the robot to
    safely navigate through each maze from start to finish.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Control Panel</h3>
    You will be presented with a control panel to help navigate the maze. Below is an annotated image of it:
    <div style="text-align:center">
      <img src="static/images/control_panel.png" alt="" />
    </div>

    In the center is the map. The robot will start around the upper left corner. The finish is a green square which could
    be located anywhere on the map. The finish will always be a visible to you and the robot. The robot will always be
    visible and be one of three colors (red, blue, or green). The 8 square surrounding the robot are visible as well as
    areas of the map you have explored. All other unexplored areas are black. The maze is made up of the following items:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Robot</b> - Your robot partner which can be any of three colors (red, blue, or green).</li>
      <li><b>Walls</b> - Which the robot cannot drive through.</li>
      <li><b>Broken Glass</b> - If driven over will confuse the robot's sensors when in Automatic Mode and may cause it to move in an unexpected direction.</li>
      <li><b>Holes</b> - If driven over the robot will fall in and fail the maze.</li>
      <li><b>Explored Areas</b> - Areas which are white. Obstacles in this area area visible.</li>
      <li><b>Unxplored Areas</b> - Areas which are black. Obstacles in this area not visible.</li>
      <li><b>Finish</b> - A visible green square located anywhere on the map.</li>
    </ol>

    Below the map are a set of buttons to control the robot. While you are playing you will have all buttons available
    to you.
    <ol>
      <li><b>Manual Control</b> - Allows you control the robot with the up, left, right,and down buttons.</li>
      <li><b>Automatic Control</b> - Remove control from you and allows the AI drive to the best of it's abilities.</li>
      <li><b>Abort Mission</b> - End the mission.</li>
      <li><b>Up</b> - In Manual Control mode, move the agent up 1 square.</li>
      <li><b>Down</b> - In Manual Control mode, move the agent down 1 square.</li>
      <li><b>Left</b> - In Manual Control mode, move the agent left 1 square.</li>
      <li><b>Right</b> - In Manual Control mode, move the agent right 1 square.</li>
    </ol>
    The control mode buttons (Manual Control and Automatic Control) will be lit green depending on which is active. Please
    note, Manual Control is significantly slower than Automatic Control, this is due to communication delays between
    you and the robot.

    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    You will receive a score (and subsequent reward) based on how many safe traverses of the mazes you and the robot
    complete. Here safe means making it to the goal. The payout is as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Base Rate</b> of $10USD per hour.</li>
      <li><b> + Bonus</b> of $0.5USD per maze if the robot reaches the goal.</li>
      <li><b> + Bonus</b> up to $0.5USD per maze if the robot reaches the goal quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    Simply put, you will receive more money if you reach the goal faster. If you fail (i.e. fall into a hole), you will
    receive just the base rate.
