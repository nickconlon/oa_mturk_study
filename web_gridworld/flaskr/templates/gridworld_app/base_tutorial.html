    You will be faced with a set of mazes of varying difficulty and paired with a robot of varying capability. You are
    allowed to driving the robot, or let the robot automatically drive. There will be dangers in the maze
    which you will need to avoid. Your view of the mazes, and control you have of the robot will be limited, so you must
    work together with your new robot partner. Your job is to work with the robot to safely navigate through each maze
    from start to finish.

    <h3>Control Panel</h3>
    You will be presented with a control panel to help navigate the maze. Below is an annotated image of it:
    <div style="text-align:center">
      <img src="static/images/control_panel.png" alt="" />
    </div>

    In the center is a map. The robot will start around the upper left corner. The finish is a green square which could
    be located anywhere on the map. The finish will always be a visible to you and the robot. The robot will always be
    visible and be one of three colors (red, blue, or green). The 8 square surrounding the robot are visible, as well as
    areas of the map you have explored. All other unexplored areas are black. The maze is made up of the following items:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Robot</b> - Your robot which can be any of three colors (red, blue, or green).</li>
      <li><b>Walls</b> - Which the robot cannot drive through.</li>
      <li><b>Broken Glass</b> - If driven over will confuse the robot's sensors when in <u>Automatic Mode</u> and may cause it to move in an unexpected direction.</li>
      <li><b>Holes</b> - If driven over the robot will fall in and <u>fail the maze</u>.</li>
      <li><b>Explored Areas</b> - Areas which are white. Obstacles in this area area visible.</li>
      <li><b>Unxplored Areas</b> - Areas which are black. Obstacles in this area not visible.</li>
      <li><b>Finish</b> - A visible green square located anywhere on the map.</li>
    </ol>

    Below the map are a set of buttons to control the robot. While you are playing you will have all buttons available
    to you.
    <ol>
      <li><b>Manual Control</b> - Allows you control the robot with the up, left, right,and down buttons.</li>
      <li><b>Automatic Control</b> - Remove control from you and allows the robot to drive to the best of it's abilities.</li>
      <li><b>Abort Mission</b> - End the mission.</li>
      <li><b>Up</b> - In Manual Control mode, move the agent up 1 square.</li>
      <li><b>Down</b> - In Manual Control mode, move the agent down 1 square.</li>
      <li><b>Left</b> - In Manual Control mode, move the agent left 1 square.</li>
      <li><b>Right</b> - In Manual Control mode, move the agent right 1 square.</li>
    </ol>
    The control mode buttons (Manual Control and Automatic Control) will be lit green depending on which is active. Please
    note, Manual Control is significantly slower than Automatic Control, this is due to communication delays between
    you and the robot.

    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    You will receive a score based on how well you and the robot perform on each maze. At the end of the HIT you will be
    paid a bonus of up to $1.00 based on your final score, and the effort you put into the experiment.

    The score breakdown is as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Successful maze finish</b>+5 points</li>
      <li><b>Failed maze</b>-5 points</li>
      <li><b>Abort maze</b>-3 points</li>
      <li><b>Drive in manual mode</b>-4 points</li>
    </ul>
