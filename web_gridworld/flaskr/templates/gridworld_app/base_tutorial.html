    During this study you will be faced with a set of mazes of varying difficulty and paired with a robot of varying capability. You are
    allowed to driving the robot, or let the robot automatically drive. You will have to watch out for dangers in the
    maze. Your view of the mazes, and control you have of the robot will be limited, so you must work together with your
    new robot partner to complete each maze.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>You will be presented with a display to help navigate the maze:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/control_panel.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <h3>To control the robot yourself click Manual Control and use the Up, Left, Right, and Down buttons:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/manual_control.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <h3>To have the robot drive itself to the finish (to the best of it's ability), select Automatic Control. You can end Automatic
      Control at any time by pressing the Manual Control button:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/automatic_control.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <h3>There will be glass like debris in the maze. If the robot is driving in Automatic Control and it drives over this debris, it could move randomly in any direction:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/glass.gif" alt="" />
    </div>


    <h3>But watch out! If the robot falls in a hole you will fail the maze:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/holes.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <h3>If you don't think you can complete the maze you can abort it:</h3>
    <div style="text-align:center; border:5px solid #555">
      <img src="static/images/abort.gif" alt="" />
    </div>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    You will receive a score based on how well you and the robot perform on each maze. At the end of the HIT you will be
    paid a bonus of up to $0.60 based on your final score, and the effort you put into the experiment. <u>Your goal should be
    to maximize points based on the below scoring breakdown:</u>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Successful maze finish</b> +5 points</li>
      <li><b>Failed maze</b> +0 points</li>
      <li><b>Abort maze</b> +2 points</li>
      <li><b>Drive in Manual Control</b> -0.1 points per step</li>
    </ul>
