    <h4>You have been paired with a new robot. In addition to Manual control, Automatic control, and Abort, it has the following capability:</h4>

     <h4><u>Self-Confidence Report:</u> This statement is what the robot thinks its outcome will be if it drives in Automatic Mode to
       the green square. It can be: 'very bad', 'bad', 'fair', 'good', or 'very good'. For example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>A report of <u>very bad</u> means the robot is quite certain it will fail while driving to the green square.</h4></li>
      <li><h4>A report of <u>bad</u> means the robot thinks there is a high (but not certain) chance it will fail while driving to the green square.</h4></li>
      <li><h4>A report of <u>fair</u> means the robot thinks there is an equal chance for failure or success.</h4></li>
      <li><h4>A report of <u>good</u> means the robot thinks there is a high (but not certain) chance it will succeed in driving to the green square.</h4></li>
      <li><h4>A report of <u>very good</u> means the robot is quite certain it will succeed in driving to the green square.</h4></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Remember, this is the robot's estimate of how it thinks it will perform in the maze in Automatic Mode, not how it thinks you will
    perform in Manual Mode. The report will be displayed just above the maze:</h4>
